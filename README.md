```

  cd uvdownloader
```

  gunicorn app:app
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000)

Done!


## How it works

It logs in to your udvash account from the back-end and fetches required video data. The video data cannot be fetched without loging in, that's why you need to provide the "Registration Number" and "Password" of your udvash account.

After downloading the video you will be logged from your browser. But don't worry, nobody is stealing your information it's just because udvash doesn't allow multi device login. Heck, it's even open source!
