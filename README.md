## How it works

It logs in to your Udvash account from the back-end and fetches the required video data. The video data cannot be fetched without logging in, that's why you need to provide the "Registration Number" and "Password" of your Udvash account.

After downloading the video, you will be logged out from your browser. But don't worry, nobody is stealing your information; it's just because Udvash doesn't allow multi-device login.
